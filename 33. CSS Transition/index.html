    <h1>CSS Transition</h1>
    <p>
      CSS Transitions are a way to control animation speed when changing CSS
      properties. They allow for a smoother transition between two states of an
      element, such as changing its color, position, or size, over a specified
      duration. Transitions can greatly enhance the interactivity and visual
      appeal of a web page by adding a more natural, gradual change to property
      adjustments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Key Features of CSS Transitions Ease of Use: Transitions are simple to
      implement, requiring only the properties you want to animate and the
      duration of the transition. Control: You can specify the duration, timing
      function, and delay of transitions. Versatility: Almost any CSS property
      can be transitioned.

      CSS Transitions are a way to control animation speed when changing CSS

      simple to implement, requiring only the properties you want to animate and
      the duration of the transition. Control: You can specify the duration,
      timing function, and delay of transitions. Versatility: Almost any CSS
      property can be transitioned. Syntax of CSS Transitions The transition
      property is a shorthand for several transition-related properties:
      transition-property: Specifies the CSS property or properties to which the
      transition effect should apply. You can specify a single property,
      multiple properties, or use all to apply the transition to all changeable
      properties. transition-duration: Defines the length of time that a
      transition takes from start to finish. transition-timing-function:
      Describes how the transition speed should progress over the duration of
      the transition. Common values include linear, ease, ease-in, ease-out, and
      ease-in-out, and you can also define custom cubic-bezier curves.
      transition-delay: Specifies a delay before the transition starts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Detailed Properties transition-property: If you have multiple properties
      to transition, you can list them separated by commas. Using all is easy
      but less performant than naming specific properties. transition-duration:
      Specifies the time period in seconds (s) or milliseconds (ms).
      transition-timing-function: linear: The transition occurs at an even
      speed. ease: Starts slow, accelerates in the middle, and slows down again
      at the end. ease-in: Starts slow and accelerates. ease-out: Starts fast
      and decelerates. ease-in-out: Starts and ends slow, but is quicker in the
      middle. transition-delay: Allows a delay to be set before the transition
      starts, useful for sequencing transitions on multiple elements.
    </p>

      Practical Considerations Performance: Transitions can be GPU accelerated,
      which improves performance, especially on mobile devices. However,
      transitioning properties like left or margin can cause reflows and
      repaints. Use properties like transform for better performance.
      Compatibility: CSS Transitions are well-supported across modern browsers,
      but always check for any specific limitations or bugs, especially in older
      browsers. CSS transitions are a straightforward way to add animations to
      web applications, enhancing user experience by providing smooth and
      gradual visual feedback.
