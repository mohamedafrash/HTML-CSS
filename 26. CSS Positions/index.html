    <h1>CSS Positions</h1>
    <p>
      CSS positioning is a fundamental concept that allows you to control the
      layout and positioning of elements within a web page. The position
      property in CSS specifies how an element is positioned in the document and
      establishes the type of positioning context for children elements. Here
      are the main values for the position property:

    <h2>Static Positioning</h2>
    <p>
      <b>static:</b> This is the default position value. Elements are positioned
      according to the normal document flow. The top, right, bottom, and left
      properties do not affect statically positioned elements. <br />
      <b>Example:</b> position: static;
    </p>
    <h2>Relative Positioning</h2>
    <p>
      <b>relative:</b> The element is positioned relative to its normal position
      in the document flow. You can use the top, right, bottom, and left
      properties to move the element from its original location. Other content
      will not adjust to fill the gap. <br /><b>Example:</b> position: relative;
      top: 10px; left: 20px;
    </p>
    <h2>Absolute Positioning</h2>
    <p>
      <b>absolute:</b> The element is removed from the normal document flow and
      positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (i.e., an ancestor
      element with a position other than static). If no such ancestor exists,
      the element is placed relative to the initial containing block (usually
      the viewport or the html element). <br /><b>Example:</b> position:
      absolute; top: 50px; right: 30px;
    </p>
    <h2>Fixed Positioning</h2>
    <p>
      <b>fixed:</b> Similar to absolute positioning, but the element is
      positioned relative to the viewport, meaning it will stay in the same
      place even if the page is scrolled. <br /><b>Example:</b> position: fixed;
      bottom: 10px; right: 10px;
    </p>
    <h2>Sticky Positioning</h2>
    <p>
      <b>sticky:</b> A hybrid of relative and fixed positioning. The element is
      treated as relative positioned until it crosses a specified point, then it
      is treated as fixed positioned. This is often used for headers that should
      scroll away with content but become fixed after a certain point. <br />
      <b>Example:</b>
      position: sticky; top: 0;
    </p>
    <h2>Z-Index</h2>
    <p>
      When elements overlap, the z-index property can control their stacking
      order (which elements appear on top of others). z-index only works on
      positioned elements (position value other than static). <br />
      <b>Example:</b> position: relative; z-index: 5;
    </p>
    <h2>Considerations</h2>
    <p>
      <b>Normal Document Flow:</b> Understanding how position: static; works is
      crucial since it's the default. Elements are laid out based on their order
      in the HTML document. <br /><b>Containing Block:</b> For absolute and
      fixed positioned elements, the reference point is the nearest positioned
      ancestor. If there isn't one, they use the viewport or the document body.
      <br /><b>Use Cases:</b> Each positioning type has specific use cases. For
      example, fixed is commonly used for navigation bars, absolute for
      dropdowns in a navbar, relative for minor adjustments from the normal
      flow, and sticky for elements that should stick after a certain scroll
      point. <br />Understanding CSS positioning is essential for effective web
      layout and design, allowing for precise control over the placement and
      behavior of elements.
