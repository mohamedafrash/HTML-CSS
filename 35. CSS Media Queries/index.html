    <h1>CSS Media Queries</h1>
    <p>
      CSS Media Queries are a powerful feature in web development that allow you
      to apply CSS styles conditionally based on the characteristics of the
      device or display, most notably its size. This makes media queries a
      fundamental tool for creating responsive designs, where content adapts
      smoothly to different screen sizes, orientations, or resolutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Key Features of CSS Media Queries Responsiveness: Media queries enable
      your website to adapt to different screen sizes, orientations, and
      resolutions, improving user experience across various devices.
      Adaptability: You can change the layout, font sizes, and visibility of
      elements based on the current viewing environment. Dynamic Presentation:
      Styles can be applied and retracted dynamically as the user resizes their
      browser or changes device orientation.
    </p>
    <p>
      A media query consists of a media type and can contain one or more
      expressions, which resolve to either true or false. The styles are then
      applied if the expression evaluates to true. css Copy code @media not|only
      mediatype and (expressions) { /* CSS Rules */ } not|only: not is used to
      exclude certain media types, whereas only can be used to prevent older
      browsers that do not support media queries with media features from
      applying given styles. mediatype: Can be all, print, screen, speech, etc.
      expressions: Evaluate certain conditions such as width, height,
      orientation, etc.

      Common Uses Breakpoints for Responsive Layouts: Change the layout at
      specific screen widths (often called breakpoints). css Copy code @media
      screen and (min-width: 600px) { .container { width: 600px; } } Different
      Styles for Portrait and Landscape: Apply different styles based on the
      orientation of the device. css Copy code @media screen and (orientation:
      portrait) { /* Portrait styles */ } @media screen and (orientation:
      landscape) { /* Landscape styles */ } High-Resolution Displays: Target
      high-density screens like Retina displays. css Copy code @media screen and
      (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2), screen and (min-resolution: 2dppx) {
      /* High-resolution styles */ } Print Styles: Customize how a page looks
      when printed. css Copy code @media print { body { font-size: 12pt; }
      .hide-on-print { display: none; } }
