    <h1>CSS Mix Blend Mode</h1>
    <p>
      CSS mix-blend-mode property allows you to specify how an element's content
      should blend with the content of the element's background or the elements
      below it. This property can create visually interesting effects on your
      web pages, such as color blending, contrast adjustments, and more
      sophisticated visual effects that previously might have required image
      editing software.
    </p>
    <ul>
      Key Features of mix-blend-mode
      <li>
        Blend Modes: Similar to blend modes in graphics editing applications
        like Photoshop, mix-blend-mode controls how pixels in two layers
        combine.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use Cases: It's particularly useful for effects like darkening,
        lightening, or applying color shifts to areas, or for creating visually
        compelling overlays and effects.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Common mix-blend-mode Values Here are some of the more commonly used
      values for mix-blend-mode: normal: This is the default value, where no
      blending is applied. multiply: Multiplies the background and the element's
      colors, resulting in a darker color. screen: Combines the background and
      the element's colors to produce a lighter color. overlay: Combines
      multiply and screen blend modes to either multiply or screen colors,
      depending on the base color. darken: Selects the darker of the base or
      blend color as the color of the resulting pixel. lighten: Selects the
      lighter of the base or blend color as the color of the resulting pixel.
      color-dodge: Brightens the base color to reflect the blend color.
      color-burn: Darkens the base color to reflect the blend color. hard-light:
      Acts like overlay, but with the layer roles reversed. soft-light: Softens
      the color by either darkening or lightening. difference: Subtracts the
      darker of the two constituent colors from the lighter color. exclusion:
      Similar to difference, but with lower contrast. hue, saturation, color,
      luminosity: These create composite colors based on the hue, saturation,
      color, or luminosity of the blend and base layers.
