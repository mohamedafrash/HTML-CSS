    <h1>Css Animaations</h1>
    <p>
      CSS animations are a powerful feature that allows you to create complex,
      multi-step animations using CSS alone. Unlike CSS transitions, which are
      intended for simple changes from one state to another, CSS animations
      offer more control over how styles change and can define multiple
      keyframes and states of the animation.

    <p>
      Key Features of CSS Animations Keyframes: CSS animations work by defining
      @keyframes that specify the styles at various points during the animation.
      You can control the intermediate steps between the start and end of the
      animation, allowing for more complex sequences. Control: You have full
      control over the timing, duration, delay, and number of times an animation
      should repeat. Fallbacks: Animations degrade gracefully. If CSS animations
      are not supported, the styles defined within the animation will not apply,
      and the user will see the static state of the elements. Syntax and Usage
      To create a CSS animation, you need two key pieces: @keyframes Rule: This
      at-rule defines the styles at various points during the animation. You
      specify what should happen at specific stages of the animation. Each stage
      can be denoted as a percentage of the total animation time from 0% (start)
      to 100% (completion).

      Animation Properties: These properties control how the animation is
      applied to elements. Here are the most common properties: animation-name:
      Specifies the name of the @keyframes rule to use. animation-duration: How
      long the animation should take to complete one cycle.
      animation-timing-function: How the animation progresses through the
      duration of each cycle (similar to transition-timing-function).
      animation-delay: Time to wait before starting the animation.
      animation-iteration-count: How many times the animation should repeat.
      infinite for endless repetition. animation-direction: Whether the
      animation should reverse direction after each cycle. animation-fill-mode:
      Defines how a CSS animation should apply styles to its target before and
      after its execution.
