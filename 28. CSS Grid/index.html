    <h1>CSS Grid</h1>
    <p>
      CSS Grid Layout (commonly known as CSS Grid) is a powerful two-dimensional
      system that revolutionizes how web developers can create complex layouts
      on the web. It allows for the creation of grid-based designs where items
      can be placed into precise columns and rows. Unlike Flexbox, which is
      great for one-dimensional layouts (either a row or a column), CSS Grid is
      designed to handle both rows and columns simultaneously.
    </p>
    <h2>Key Concepts of CSS Grid</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Grid Container:</b> The element on which display: grid; or display:
        inline-grid; is applied. It becomes the grid container.
      </li>
      <li><b>Grid Item:</b> The direct children of the grid container.</li>
      <li>
        <b>Grid Line:</b> The dividing lines that make up the structure of the
        grid. They can be vertical (column lines) or horizontal (row lines).
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Grid Track:</b> The space between two adjacent grid lines. You can
        think of them as columns or rows.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Grid Cell:</b> The space between two adjacent row and two adjacent
        column grid lines. It's a single "cell" in the grid.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Grid Area:</b> A total space surrounded by four grid lines. A grid
        area may be composed of any number of grid cells.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Grid Container Properties</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>display:</b> Defines an element as a grid container and establishes a
        new grid formatting context for its contents.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Values:</b> grid (creates a block-level grid), inline-grid (creates
        an inline-level grid).
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows:</b> Defines the columns
        and rows of the grid with a space-separated list of values. The values
        represent the size of the grid lines.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>grid-gap</b> (also known as gap in the newest syntax): Sets the
        spacing between the grid items.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>grid-auto-rows and grid-auto-columns:</b> Specifies the size of any
        auto-generated grid rows (or columns).
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>grid-template-areas:</b> Defines a grid template by referencing the
        names of grid areas.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Grid Item Properties</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b
          >grid-column-start, grid-column-end, grid-row-start, and
          grid-row-end:</b
        >
        Determine where a grid item’s placement begins and ends.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>grid-column and grid-row:</b> Shorthand properties for setting grid
        items' start and end lines simultaneously.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>grid-area:</b> Can specify a grid item’s location within the grid by
        referring to a custom name assigned to one of the grid-template-areas.
      </li>
    </ul>
