    <h1>CSS Box Model</h1>
    <p>
      The CSS Box Model is a fundamental concept in web design and development
      that describes the rectangular boxes that are generated for elements in
      the document tree and rendered according to the visual formatting model.
      Each box has four areas, defined by their respective edges: the content
      edge, padding edge, border edge, and margin edge.
    </p>
    <h2>Components of the Box Model</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Content: </b>This is the area where text and images appear. Its size
        can be controlled using the width and height properties.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Padding:</b> Padding is the space between the content and the border.
        ItMargin: and can increase the size of the box if a width and height are
        set. Padding is included in the click area of a box.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Border:</b> The border surrounds the padding (if any) and content.
        It's the edge that can be styled with size, color, and style.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Margin:</b> Margin is the outermost layer and creates space between
        the element's border and its surrounding elements. Unlike padding,
        margins are not part of the click area and are transparent.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Box Model Properties width and height: Specify the width and height of the
      content area. padding: Controls the padding area's size. Can be specified
      for all sides together or for each side individually (padding-top,
      padding-right, padding-bottom, padding-left). border: Defines the border's
      width, style, and color. Like padding, it can be set for all sides or each
      side individually. margin: Controls the size of the margin area. Can also
      be specified for each side individually. Box-Sizing The box-sizing
      property allows you to alter the box model's default behavior: content-box
      (default): The width and height properties include only the content, not
      the padding or border. border-box: The width and height properties include
      content, padding, and border, but not the margin. This makes it easier to
      size elements.
