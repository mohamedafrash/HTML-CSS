        HTML forms are used to collect user input. A form can contain input elements like text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, submit buttons, and more. Forms are defined using the <form> tag.

Basic Structure
A typical form has the following structure:

<form>: The container for the form elements. Attributes like action (the URL to send the form data to) and method (how to send the data, typically get or post) are specified here.
Form Elements: Such as <input>, <textarea>, <button>, <select>, and others, each serving different purposes for user input.
<label>: Used to define labels for form elements, improving accessibility and user experience.
Key Attributes of the <form> Tag
action: The URL where the form data is sent when the form is submitted.
method: The HTTP method to send the form data with. Common values are get (data is sent in the URL) and post (data is sent in the request body).
Common Form Elements
<input>: The most versatile form element, with various types including text, password, submit, radio, checkbox, and more.
<textarea>: A multi-line text input field, useful for longer user inputs like comments or messages.
<button>: Represents a clickable button, which can be configured to submit the form, reset the form, or perform custom JavaScript actions.
<select>: A drop-down list that allows the user to select one or more options from a list.
<option>: Defines the options within a <select> list.
<label>: Provides a label for form elements. Using the for attribute to associate the label with a specific form element improves accessibility.
