    <h1>Display Property</h1>
    <p>
      The display property in CSS determines how an element is displayed on the
      web page. It's one of the most important CSS properties for controlling
      layout. The value of this property defines the display behavior (the type
      of rendering box) of an element.
    </p>
    <h2>Common display Values:</h2>
    <p>
      <li>
        none: The element is completely removed from the document flow and not
        rendered, meaning it takes up no space. Unlike visibility: hidden;,
        display: none; removes the element from the document layout entirely.
        Example: display: none;
      </li>
      <li>
        block: The element is displayed as a block-level element, starting on a
        new line and taking up the full width available. Examples of block-level
        elements include div, p, and h1 to h6. Example: display: block;
      </li>
      <li>
        inline: The element is displayed as an inline element, meaning it does
        not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.
        Examples of inline elements include span, a, and img. Example: display:
        inline;
      </li>
      <li>
        inline-block: The element is placed as an inline element (on the same
        line as adjacent content), but it behaves as a block-level element
        regarding the content inside it. This means you can set the element's
        width and height values. Example: display: inline-block;
      </li>
      <li>
        flex: The element behaves like a block-level element and lays out its
        content according to the flexbox model. It's a modern layout mode that
        provides a more efficient way to lay out, align, and distribute space
        among items in a container. Example: display: flex;
      </li>
      <li>
        grid: The element behaves like a block-level element and lays out its
        content according to the grid model. It offers a grid-based layout
        system with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages
        without having to use floats and positioning. Example: display: grid;
      </li>
      <li>
        table, table-row, table-cell: These values make the element behave like
        a table td tr, etc. respectively. They can be used for layouts that
        require table-like structures. Example: display: table-cell;
      </li>
    </p>
