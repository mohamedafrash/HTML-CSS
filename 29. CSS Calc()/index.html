    <h1>Css Calc()</h1>
    <p>
      The CSS calc() function is a versatile tool that allows you to perform
      calculations to determine CSS property values. This function can be
      incredibly useful for creating dynamic layouts and sizes that adapt to
      different conditions in a responsive design. It supports basic arithmetic
      operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

    <h2>Key Features of calc()</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Mix Units:</b> calc() can combine different units, making it possible
        to use percentages, pixels, ems, rems, vh, vw, and more within a single
        expression. This is particularly useful in responsive designs where you
        might want to mix fixed and relative sizes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Nested Calculations:</b> You can nest multiple calc() functions
        within each other to perform complex computations.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Compatibility:</b> calc() is widely supported in all modern browsers,
        making it a reliable choice for cross-browser compatibility.
      </li>
    </ul>

      Syntax css Copy code calc(expression) Where expression is a formula that
      can include: Numerical values: e.g., 10, 20px, 50% Operators: +, -, *, /
      Parentheses for grouping: e.g., (10px + 100%) Common Uses of calc()
      Responsive Layouts: Adjust widths, margins, and positions that respond to
      viewport changes while including offsets or additional static space. css
      Copy code width: calc(100% - 20px); This sets the width of an element to
      be the full width of its container minus 20 pixels. Mixing Units: Combine
      relative and absolute measurements. css Copy code font-size: calc(1rem +
      2vw); This adjusts the font size dynamically based on the width of the
      viewport while starting with a base size of 1rem. Vertical Centering:
      Position elements vertically when you know their height. css Copy code
      top: calc(50% - 20px); This positions the top of an element halfway down
      its container, minus 20 pixels to offset half its height for true
      centering (assuming the element is 40px tall). Grid Gaps in Layouts:
      Create layouts with consistent spacing between items. css Copy code
      grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, calc((100% - 30px) / 4)); This
      creates a grid layout with columns that automatically fill the space,
      accounting for 30px of total gap, evenly distributed.
