    <h1>CSS Colors</h1>
    <p>
      In CSS, colors can be specified in various ways, offering flexibility in
      design and styling. They can be applied to text, backgrounds, borders, and
      other elements. Here are the primary methods to define colors in CSS: ###
      Named Colors CSS supports a set of predefined color names, such as `red`,
      `green`, `blue`, `black`, `white`, and many others. These are intuitive
      and easy to remember. - **Example**: `color: blue;` ### HEX Values HEX
      color values are specified with a hash symbol (#) followed by a 6-digit
      code, which represents the intensity of red, green, and blue (in
      hexadecimal notation). There are also shorthand 3-digit HEX codes for
      colors with equal red, green, and blue components. - **Example**: `color:
      #FF5733;` (Full HEX) or `color: #F00;` (Shorthand HEX for red) ### RGB and
      RGBA RGB color values are defined using the `rgb()` function with three
      parameters for red, green, and blue, each ranging from 0 to 255. RGBA adds
      a fourth parameter, alpha, which specifies the opacity of the color,
      ranging from 0 (fully transparent) to 1 (fully opaque). - **Examples**: -
      RGB: `color: rgb(255, 87, 51);` - RGBA: `color: rgba(255, 87, 51, 0.5);`
      ### HSL and HSLA HSL stands for Hue, Saturation, and Lightness. Hue is
      specified as an angle (from 0 to 360) on the color wheel, saturation is a
      percentage value, and lightness is also a percentage. HSLA adds an alpha
      channel for opacity. - **Examples**: - HSL: `color: hsl(9, 100%, 60%);` (A
      shade of red) - HSLA: `color: hsla(9, 100%, 60%, 0.5);` ### CurrentColor
      The `currentColor` keyword refers to the current value of the `color`
      property. It allows you to use the color defined for text as a value for
      other properties like `border-color` or `background-color`. - **Example**:
      `border: 1px solid currentColor;` ### Transparency with Opacity The
      `opacity` property in CSS doesn't specify a color but affects the
      transparency level of an element, including its content, and is defined by
      a number between 0.0 (completely transparent) and 1.0 (completely opaque).
      - **Example**: `opacity: 0.5;` When choosing colors, consider readability,
      contrast, and accessibility to ensure content is easily discernible to all
      users. Tools like color pickers and online resources can help you select
      and harmonize colors for your web designs.
