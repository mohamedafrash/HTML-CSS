    <h1>CSS Units</h1>
    <h2>Absolute Units</h2>
    <p>
      px (Pixels): The most common unit used in screen-based design. One pixel
      is equal to one dot on the digital screen.
    </p>
    <div class="px"></div>
    <h2>Relative Units</h2>
    <p>
      Relative units are flexible and change their value based on other
      properties, making them very useful for responsive design.
    </p>
    <p class="em">
      em: Relative to the font-size of the element. If you haven't set font size
      anywhere on the page, then it is relative to the browser's default font
      size (usually 16px). An em is equal to the computed font size of its
      parent.
    </p>
    <p class="rem">
      rem (Root EM): Similar to em, but always relative to the root element's
      (html) font size, making it consistent across the entire document.
    </p>
    <p>
      vw (Viewport Width): Based on 1% of the width of the viewport. For
      example, 50vw is 50% of the viewport width. vh (Viewport Height): Based on
      1% of the height of the viewport. For example, 50vh is 50% of the viewport
      height.
    </p>
    <div class="vw"></div>
    <p>
      % (Percentage): Often used for widths, margins, and padding, and is
      relative to the parent element's dimension.
    </p>
