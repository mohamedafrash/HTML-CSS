        Semantic HTML refers to the practice of using HTML markup to reinforce the semantics, or meaning, of the information in webpages and web applications rather than merely to define its presentation or look. Semantic HTML is achieved by using HTML tags that provide information about the contained content beyond just how it should look on a page.

### Importance of Semantic HTML
- **Accessibility**: Helps screen readers and other assistive technologies understand the structure and navigation of your page, making it more accessible to users with disabilities.
- **SEO**: Search engines use the semantics of web page content to understand and rank pages more effectively.
- **Maintainability**: Makes the code easier to read and maintain, both for the original authors and for other developers who might work on the same codebase in the future.
- **Interoperability**: Ensures more consistent behavior across different browsers and devices.

### Examples of Semantic HTML Tags

- **`<header>`**: Represents introductory content or a set of navigational links.
- **`<nav>`**: Designates a section of the page for navigation links.
- **`<main>`**: Specifies the main content of a document.
- **`<article>`**: Encapsulates a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable.
- **`<section>`**: Defines a section in a document, such as chapters, headers, footers, or any other sections of the document.
- **`<aside>`**: Represents a portion of a document whose content is only indirectly related to the document's main content.
- **`<footer>`**: Specifies the footer for a document or section.
- **`<figure>`** and **`<figcaption>`**: Used to associate a figure with a caption.
- **`<details>`** and **`<summary>`**: Provide a way to encapsulate interactive widgets that users can show or hide.
- **`<mark>`**: Highlights parts of text.
- **`<time>`**: Represents a specific period in time.

### Non-Semantic vs. Semantic HTML
Non-semantic tags, like `<div>` and `<span>`, tell nothing about their content and are used purely for styling purposes. On the other hand, semantic tags clearly describe the meaning of the content and its structure.

### Using Semantic HTML
When writing HTML, always try to use elements for their given purpose as much as possible. This approach not only makes your HTML more accessible but also conveys to future developers and technologies what the purpose of various parts of your content is.

For example, instead of using a `<div>` for a navigational menu, it's more semantic to use the `<nav>` element, as it clearly describes the purpose of the navigation links contained within it.

In summary, semantic HTML is a best practice that should be followed to ensure that web content is accessible, understandable, and usable across different platforms and devices.
