        The CSS :is() function is a powerful selector introduced to simplify
        complex CSS selector chains by reducing repetition and improving
        readability. It's a part of the CSS Selectors Level 4 specification and
        is especially useful when you need to apply the same styles to various
        selectors while keeping the stylesheet clean and easy to maintain. Key
        Features of :is() Streamlining Selectors: :is() allows you to group
        multiple selectors into a single, more concise rule. Maintainability: By
        reducing the complexity and repetition of selector lists, :is() makes
        stylesheets easier to maintain and understand. Flexibility: It can
        accept any valid selector as an argument, including universal, class,
        ID, type, and pseudo-class selectors.
