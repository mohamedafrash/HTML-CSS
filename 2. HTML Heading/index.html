      HTML headings are used to structure content by providing titles or headings to 
      different sections of a web page. They range from <h1> to <h6>, with <h1> being 
      the highest (or most important) level and <h6> the lowest. Each level of 
      heading tag displays text with a different size and weight by default, with <h1>
      being the largest and <h6> the smallest.

Here's a brief overview of each:

<h1>: This is typically used for the main title or heading of a page. 
It's the most important heading, and there should usually be only one 
<h1> element on a page, representing the main focus of the page's content.

<h2>: Used for subsections under the <h1> tag. 
It's a subheading to the main title and helps organize
content into manageable sections.

<h3> to <h6>: These are used for subheadings under the <h2> heading,
with each level representing a further subdivision of content.
They help break down sections under the main and subheadings into more specific parts.

The use of headings is not only about visual styling but also plays a crucial role in SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and accessibility. Proper use of headings can help search engines understand the structure and importance of your content, and screen readers use them to navigate the page for users with disabilities.
